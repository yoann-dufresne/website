My name is **Yoann Dufresne**.
I am a computer scientist holding a PhD in bioinformatics from the university of Lille (France).
I do my research in the Bonsai Group on [exact algorithmic for nonribosomal peptide annotations](https://yoann-dufresne.github.io/Thesis/manuscrit.pdf "My thesis").  

During my 3 years of thesis, I gave many lectures in the computer science department of [Lille 1](http://www.univ-lille1.fr/), from programming basics in C or JAVA for bahelor's degree students to Advance algorithms and Kernel programming for master's degree students.  

I'm also a frequent participant of algorithms contests and soon I will add a blog on this website to explain my reflexions on different algorithm problems.  

For more details on me, you can download my [CV](data/CV-1page.pdf) or look at my research section.
